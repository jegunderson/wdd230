                        Jcpenney's website demonstrates the principle of repitition. There are several repeating aspects of this page. To start off, in their nav bar they have several different options each set up the same way, with the same font, same text color, and text size. Not only are those options all repeating each other but further down they have several options of what to shop for. Each has an identically shaped picture with an identically formatted description. Throughout the site there are many more examples of repitition that highlight just how effective the usage of this principle is.

                        Amazon is a perfect example of what not to do in accordance with Hick's Law. Hick's Law states that the more options you have available the longer it will take your customer to make a decision. Amazon has differeny buttons, pictures, links, and more everywhere on their page. Every inch you scroll ten more options appear. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, the longer a customer spends on your site the longer they are invested in your company. There is a balance that should be found to not annoy your customer and make them leave without purchasing anything.

                    <p>
                        Amazon shows how to use white space extremely well. They have small amounts of padding between images showing the edges which also gives breathing space between items. They also have big gaps of white space between sections. They do not overload you with information or colors. They keep it nice and simple and pleasing to look at. With the background itself also being white, it looks a little roomier and even less cluttered than it would have been if they had a background color and then a different colored margins.
